                    History of HTML
                </h3>
                <p>
                    HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. HTML has played a crucial role in
                    the development of the web, transforming
                    <br>
                    from a simple markup language into a
                    powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
                </p>

                            Tim Berners-Lee:
                        </b>
                        HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN
                        (European Organization for Nuclear Research). In 1989, he proposed a system to
                        share and navigate information on the internet using hypertext.

                            First Proposal.
                        </b>
                        The first proposal for the World Wide Web was published in 1989, and by 1991,
                        the first version of HTML was developed, consisting of 18 tags.

                            Standardisation:
                        </b>
                        The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed the HTML Working Group in 1994
                        to create standards for HTML. HTML 2.0 was published in 1995 as the first
                        standardised version, incorporating features from
                        <br>
                        the original HTML and
                        additional elements from browser developers.

                            HTML 3.2:
                        </b>
                        Released in 1997, HTML 3.2 added support for tables, applets, and text flow
                        around images. It was a significant step towards more complex web pages.

                            HTML 4:
                        </b>
                        Also released in 1997, HTML 4.0 introduced several new elements and attributes
                        for scripting, style sheets, and accessibility. It was a major update that
                        provided better support for multimedia and forms.

                        </b>
                        XHTML 1 was introduced as a reformulation of HTML 4 in XML (Extensible Markup
                        Language).
                        <br> 
                        It aimed to bring stricter syntax rules and better document
                        structure, promoting cleaner, more consistent code.

                        HTML5 was developed to address the limitations of HTML4 and XHTML. Work on HTML5
                        began around 2004, and it was officially published as a W3C Recommendation in
                        2014.

                        HTML5 introduced a wide range of new elements and APIs for multimedia (audio,
                        video), graphics (canvas, SVG), and interactive content. It also improved
                        support for web applications, form controls, and offline storage.

                        Technology Working Group (WHATWG). This means it is continuously updated and
